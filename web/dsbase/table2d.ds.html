<h2>Creates 2-dimensional contingency tables - potentially disclosive data are suppressed</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The function table2d.ds is a server-side subfunction of
datashield.aggregate(). It generates 2-dimensional tables
for all data sources. Valid (non-disclosive) data are
defined as data from sources where no table cells have
counts between 1 and 4 (the upper value [4] can in
principle be changed but only by rewriting the underlying
function - it cannot be changed by a standard DataSHIELD
user). If the count in any cell in the table produced by
a given data source IS invalid, that cell count is
changed to &quot;-1&quot; and the name of the two categories that
correspond to it are both changed to &quot;-9&quot;. Each source is
flagged as having only valid data, or at least some
invalid data.Missing data are treated as
na.action=na.omit (default for table function), if
missing data are to be treated as a separate and visible
category, the variable should first be transformed to
convert NAs to the a new value.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
  table2d.ds(xvect, yvect)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>xvect</code></td>
<td>
<p>a numerical vector with discrete values -
usually a factor</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>yvect</code></td>
<td>
<p>a numerical vector with discrete values -
usually a factor</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list object (eg. named out.obj) with one component from
each separate study which contains the following items:
</p>
<table summary="R valueblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>is.table.valid</code></td>
<td>
<p>eg. out.obj[[2]]$is.table.valid is
a logical (Boolean) indicator of whether the data in
study 2 is entirely valid (TRUE) for the stated variable
or at least one category is invalid (FALSE)</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>safe.table</code></td>
<td>
<p>eg. out.obj[[1]]$safe.table contains
the safe (non-disclosive) one dimensional table that can
be released from study 1 - unsafe data are concealed by
converting invalid counts to &quot;-1&quot; and their corresponding
catregory identifier to &quot;-9&quot;</p>
</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre>
## Not run: 
# load the file that contains the login details
data(logindata)

# login and assign the required variables to R
library(opal)
myvar &lt;- list("DIS_DIAB","GENDER","LAB_HDL")
opals &lt;- datashield.login(logins=logindata,assign=TRUE,variables=myvar)

# Example 1: generate a two dimensional table
datashield.aggregate(opals, quote(table2d.ds(D$DIS_CVA,D$GENDER)))

# Example 2: generate a two dimensional table, outputting study specific and combined contingency tables, see what happens if
you try to tabulate a quantitative variable with unique values for many individuals. The standard table() function in R would print out
all observed "values" as category names in ascending order with a count (generally 1) for each unique number, but ds.table1d prints
out all values where there are between 1 and 4 observations as -1 and gives the category name -9. It is only when the count is
5 or more that the actual value can be observed, and then it is non-disclosive
datashield.aggregate(opals, quote(table2d.ds(D$GENDER,D$LAB_HDL)))
