<h3>Details</h3>

<p>ds.glmSLMA specifies the structure of a generalized linear model (glm)
to be fitted separately on each study. The model is first constructed
and subject to preliminary disclosure checking
by glmSLMADS1. This aggregate function then returns this 
output to ds.glmSLMA which processes the information and uses it in a call to
glmSLMADS2. This call specifies and fits the required glm in each data source.
Unlike glmDS2 (called by the more commonly used generalized linear modelling
client-side function ds.glm) the requested model is then fitted to completion
on the data in each study rather than iteration by iteration on all studies
combined. At the end of this SLMA fitting process
glmSLMADS2 returns study-specific parameter estimates
and standard errors to the client. These can then be pooled using random
effects (or fixed effects) meta-analysis - eg using the metafor package.
This mode of model fitting may
reasonably be called study level meta-analysis (SLMA) although the analysis
is based on estimates and standard errors derived from direct analysis of
the individual level data in each study rather than from published study
summaries (as is often the case with SLMA of clinical trials etc).
Furthermore, unlike common approaches to study-level meta-analysis
adopted by large multi-study research consortia (eg in the combined analysis
of identical genomic markers across multiple studies), the parallel
analyses (in every study) under ds.glmSLMA are
controlled entirely from one client. This avoids the time-consuming
need to ask each study to run its own analyses and the consequent
necessity to request additional work from individual studies if
the modelling is to be extended to include analyses not subsumed
in the original analytic plan. Additional analyses of this nature
may, for example, include analyses based on interactions between covariates
identified as having significant main effects in the original analysis. 
From a mathematical perspective, the SLMA approach (using ds.glmSLMA)
differs fundamentally from the usual approach using ds.glm
in that the latter is mathematically equivalent
to placing all individual-level data from all sources in
one central warehouse and analysing those data as one combined dataset using the
conventional glm() function in R. However, although this
may sound to be preferable under all circumstances, the SLMA approach
actually offers key inferential advantages when there is marked heterogeneity
between sources that cannot simply be corrected with fixed effects each reflecting a study
or centre-effect. In particular, fixed effects cannot simply be used in this way when there
there is heterogeneity in the effect that is of scientific interest. 
For more details please see the extensive header for ds.glmSLMA
in DataSHIELD and help on the glm function in native R.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>All quantitative, Boolean, and character objects required to
enable the SLMA pooling of the separate glm models fitted to each study -
in particular including the study-specific regression coefficients and their corresponding
standard errors. Also, returns warning flags
and associated information enabling DataSHIELD to halt analysis and destroy
model output from any
given study if a disclosure trap is triggered and to inform the user
what trap has been triggered.
