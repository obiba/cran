<h2>Creates 1-dimensional contingency tables - potentially disclosive data are suppressed</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The function table1d.ds is a server-side subfunction of
datashield.aggregate(). It generates 1-dimensional tables
for all data sources. Valid (non-disclosive) data are
defined as data from sources where no table cells have
counts between 1 and 4 (the upper value [4] can in
principle be changed but only by rewriting the underlying
function - it cannot be changed by a standard DataSHIELD
user). If the count in any cell in the table produced by a
given data source IS invalid, that cell count is changed to
&quot;-1&quot; and the name of the category that corresponds to it is
changed to &quot;-9&quot;. Each source is flagged as having only
valid data, or at least some invalid data. Missing data are
treated as na.action=na.omit (default for table function),
if missing data are to be treated as a separate and visible
category, the variable should first be transformed to
convert NAs to the a new value.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
table1dDS(xvect)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>xvect</code></td>
<td>
<p>a numerical vector with discrete values -
usually a factor</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list object (eg. named out.obj) with one component from
each separate study which contains the following items:
</p>
<table summary="R valueblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>is.table.valid</code></td>
<td>
<p>eg. out.obj[[2]]$is.table.valid is a
logical (Boolean) indicator of whether the data in study 2
is entirely valid (TRUE) for the stated variable or at
least one category is invalid (FALSE)</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>safe.table</code></td>
<td>
<p>eg. out.obj[[1]]$safe.table contains the
safe (non-disclosive) one dimensional table that can be
released from study 1 - unsafe data are concealed by
converting invalid counts to &quot;-1&quot; and their corresponding
catregory identifier to &quot;-9&quot;</p>
</td></tr>
</table>
