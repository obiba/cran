<h2>seqDS a serverside assign function called by ds.seq</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>assign function seqDS called by ds.seq
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
seqDS(
  FROM.value.char,
  TO.value.char,
  BY.value.char,
  LENGTH.OUT.value.char,
  ALONG.WITH.name
)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>FROM.value.char</code></td>
<td>
<p>the starting value for the sequence expressed as an integer
or real number with a decimal point but 
in character form. Fully specified by &lt;FROM.value.char&gt; argument
of ds.seq.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>TO.value.char</code></td>
<td>
<p>the terminal value for the sequence expressed as an integer
or real number with a decimal point but 
in character form. Fully specified by &lt;TO.value.char&gt; argument
of ds.seq.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>BY.value.char</code></td>
<td>
<p>the value to increment each step in the sequence
expressed as an integer
or real number with a decimal point but 
in character form. Fully specified by &lt;BY.value.char&gt; argument
of ds.seq.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>LENGTH.OUT.value.char</code></td>
<td>
<p>length of the sequence at which point
its extension should be stopped, expressed as an integer
or real number with a decimal point but 
in character form. Fully specified by &lt;LENGTH.OUT.value.char&gt; argument
of ds.seq.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>ALONG.WITH.name</code></td>
<td>
<p>For convenience, rather than specifying a value
for LENGTH.OUT it can often be better to specify a variable name as
the &lt;ALONG.WITH.name&gt; argument. Fully specified by &lt;ALONG.WITH.name&gt; argument
of ds.seq.</p>
</td></tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>An assign function that uses the native R function seq() to create
any one of a flexible range of sequence vectors that can then be used to help
manage and analyse data. As it is an assign function the resultant vector is
written as a new object into all of the specified data source servers. Please
see &quot;details&quot; for ds.seq for more information about allowable combinations
of arguments etc.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>the object specified by the &lt;newobj&gt; argument of
ds.seq (or its default name newObj)
which is written to the serverside. 
As well as writing the output object as &lt;newobj&gt;
on the serverside, two validity messages are returned
indicating whether &lt;newobj&gt; has been created in each data source and if so whether
it is in a valid form. If its form is not valid in at least one study - e.g. because
a disclosure trap was tripped and creation of the full output object was blocked -
ds.seq() also returns any studysideMessages that can explain the error in creating
the full output object. As well as appearing on the screen at run time,if you wish to
see the relevant studysideMessages at a later date you can use the ds.message
function. If you type ds.message(&quot;&lt;newobj&gt;&quot;) it will print out the relevant
studysideMessage from any datasource in which there was an error in creating &lt;newobj&gt;
and a studysideMessage was saved. If there was no error and &lt;newobj&gt; was created
without problems no studysideMessage will have been saved and ds.message(&quot;&lt;newobj&gt;&quot;)
will return the message: &quot;ALL OK: there are no studysideMessage(s) on this datasource&quot;.
