<h2>unListDS a serverside aggregate function called by ds.unList</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Coerces an R object back from a list towards
the class it was before being coerced to a list
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
unListDS(x.name, recursive, newobj)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>x.name</code></td>
<td>
<p>the name of the input object to be coerced back from
class list. It must be specified in inverted commas. But this argument is
usually specified directly by &lt;x.name&gt; argument of the clientside function
ds.unList</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>recursive</code></td>
<td>
<p>argument required for native R unlist function - see
native R help for unlist function</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>newobj</code></td>
<td>
<p>is the object hard assigned '&lt;&lt;-' to be the output of the
function written to the serverside</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Unlike most other class coercing functions this is
an aggregate function rather than an assign function. This
is because the datashield.assign function in opal deals specially with
a created object (newobj) if it is of class list. Reconfiguring the
function as an aggregate function works around this problem.
This aggregate function is based on the native R function unlist
and so additional information can be found in the help for unlist.
When an object is coerced to a list, depending
on the class of the original object some information may be lost. Thus,
for example, when a data.frame is coerced to a list information that
underpins the structure of the data.frame is lost and when it is
subject to the function ds.unlist it is returned to a simpler
class than data.frame eg 'numeric' (basically a numeric vector
containing all of the original data in all variables in the data.frame
but with no structure). If you wish to reconstruct the original
data.frame you therefore need to specify this structure again e.g.
the column names etc
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>the object specified by the &lt;newobj&gt; argument (or its default name
&lt;x.name&gt;.mat) which is written to the serverside.
In addition, two validity messages are returned. The first confirms an output
object has been created, the second states its class.
