<h2>unListDS a serverside assign function called by ds.unList</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>this function is based on the native R function unlist
which coerces an object of list class back to the class it was when
it was coerced into a list
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
unListDS(x.name)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>x.name</code></td>
<td>
<p>the name of the input object to be unlisted.
It must be specified in inverted commas e.g. x.name=&quot;input.object.name&quot;. Fully
specified by the &lt;x.name&gt; argument of ds.unList</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>See details of the native R function unlist.
This function represents a substantive restructuring of an earlier version
created by Amadou Gaye. For further details of its working please
see 'details' in the help for ds.unList.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>the object specified by the &lt;newobj&gt; argument of the 
ds.unList function (or by default &lt;x.name&gt;.unlist
if the &lt;newobj&gt; argument is NULL). This is written to the serverside.
As well as writing the output object as &lt;newobj&gt;
on the serverside, two validity messages are returned
indicating whether &lt;newobj&gt; has been created in each data source and if so whether
it is in a valid form. If its form is not valid in at least one study - e.g. because
a disclosure trap was tripped and creation of the full output object was blocked -
ds.seq() also returns any studysideMessages that can explain the error in creating
the full output object. As well as appearing on the screen at run time,if you wish to
see the relevant studysideMessages at a later date you can use the ds.message
function. If you type ds.message(&quot;&lt;newobj&gt;&quot;) it will print out the relevant
studysideMessage from any datasource in which there was an error in creating &lt;newobj&gt;
and a studysideMessage was saved. Because the outcome object from ds.unList is
typically a list object with no names, if there are no errors in creating it
the message returned from ds.message(&quot;&lt;newobj&gt;&quot;) in each study will read
&quot;Outcome object is a list without names. So a studysideMessage may be hidden.
Please check output is OK&quot;. This suggests that - in the case of this specific
function - one should check as far as one can
the nature of the output from a call to ds.unList - e.g. ds.class, ds.length etc
