<h2>setSeedDs called by ds.setSeed, ds.rNorm, ds.rUnif,
ds.rPois and ds.rBinom</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>An aggregate serverside function that primes
the pseudorandom number generator in a data source
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
setSeedDS(seedtext = NULL, kind = NULL, normal.kind = NULL)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>seedtext</code></td>
<td>
<p>this is simply the value of the &lt;seed.as.integer&gt; argument
of ds.setSeed, ds.rNorm, ds.rUnif, ds.rPois of ds.rBinom coerced
into character format. This is done by the clientside functions themselves
and does not require the DataSHIELD user to do anything. Please see the
help for these clientside functions, and in particular, the information
for the argument &lt;seed.as.integer&gt; for more details.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>setSeedDS is effectively equivalent to the native R function
set.seed() and so the help for that function can provide many
additional details. The only very minor difference is that the
first argument of setSeedDS, &lt;seedtext&gt; takes the integer priming
seed in character format. However, for the user that integer is still
specified directly as an integer as the &lt;seed.as.integer&gt; argument
of one of the clientside functions ds.setSeed, ds.rNorm .....
Each of these clientside functions coerces the integer to character format
calls setSeedDS and the first active line of code in setSeedDS converts
the character string back to an integer and treats it as the first
argument &lt;seed&gt; of the native R function set.seed(). The two other
arguments of set.seed() in native R, &lt;kind&gt; and &lt;normal.kind&gt; are both
defaulted by specifying them as NULL. This defaulting is hard wired into
the setSeedDS function and as this cannot be changed by the analyst it means
that setSeedDS is much less flexible than native R's set.seed() function.
If any DataSHIELD user requires some aspect of this flexibility returned
the development team can be approached, but unless you are actually doing
theoretical work with random number generators it is likely that the

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Sets the values of the vector of integers of length 626 known as
.Random.seed on each data source that is the true current state of the
random seed in each source.
