<h2>Calculates the coordinates of the data to be plot</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function uses two disclosure control methods to generate non-disclosive
coordinates that are returned to the client that generates the non-disclosive scatter plots.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
scatterPlotDS(x, y, method.indicator, k, noise)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>the name of a numeric vector, the x-variable.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>y</code></td>
<td>
<p>the name of a numeric vector, the y-variable.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>method.indicator</code></td>
<td>
<p>an integer either 1 or 2. If the user selects the deterministic
method in the client side function the method.indicator is set to 1 while if the user selects
the probabilistic method this argument is set to 2.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>k</code></td>
<td>
<p>the number of the nearest neghbours for which their centroid is calculated if the
deterministic method is selected.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>noise</code></td>
<td>
<p>the percentage of the initial variance that is used as the variance of the embedded
noise if the probabilistic method is selected.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>If the user chooses the deterministic approach, the function finds the k-1 nearest
neighbours of each data point in a 2-dimensional space. The nearest neighbours are the data
points with the minimum Euclidean distances from the point of interest. Each point of interest
and its k-1 nearest neighbours are then used for the calculation of the coordinates of the
centroid of those k points. Centroid here is referred to the centre of mass, i.e. the
x-coordinate of the centroid is the average value of the x-coordinates of the k nearest
neighbours and the y-coordinate of the centroid is the average of the y-coordinates of the k
nearest neighbours. If the user chooses the probabilistic approach, the function adds random
noise to $x$ and $y$ separately. Each random noise follows a normal distribution with zero mean
and variance equal to 10
disclosure we fix the random number generator in a value that is specified by the input
variables. Thus the function returns always the same noisy data for a given pair of variables.
