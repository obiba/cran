<h2>completeCasesDS: an assign function called by ds.completeCases</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Identifies and strips out all rows of a data.frame,
matrix or vector that contain NAs.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
completeCasesDS(x1.transmit)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>x1.transmit</code></td>
<td>
<p>This argument determines the input data.frame,
matrix or vector from which rows with NAs are to be stripped. 
The &lt;x1.transmit&gt; argument is fully specified by the &lt;x1&gt; argument
of the ds.completeCases function.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In the case of a data.frame or matrix, completeCasesDS identifies
all rows containing one or more NAs and deletes those
rows altogether. Any one variable with NA in a given row will lead
to deletion of the whole row. In the case of a vector, completeCasesDS
acts in an equivalent manner but there is no equivalent to a 'row'
and so it simply strips out all observations recorded as NA.
ds.completeCASES is analogous to the complete.cases function
in native R. Limited additional information can therefore be found
under help(&quot;complete.cases&quot;) in native R.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a modified data.frame, matrix or vector from which
all rows containing at least one NA have been deleted. This
modified object is written to the serverside in each source.
In addition, two validity messages are returned
indicating whether &lt;newobj&gt; has been created in each data source and if so whether
it is in a valid form. If its form is not valid in at least one study - e.g. because
a disclosure trap was tripped and creation of the full output object was blocked -
ds.completeCases also returns any studysideMessages that can help
explain the error in creating
the full output object. As well as appearing on the screen at run time,if you wish to
see the relevant studysideMessages at a later date you can use the ds.message
function. If you type ds.message(&quot;newobj&quot;) it will print out the relevant
studysideMessage from any datasource in which there was an error in creating &lt;newobj&gt;
and a studysideMessage was saved. If there was no error and &lt;newobj&gt; was created
without problems no studysideMessage will have been saved and ds.message(&quot;newobj&quot;)
will return the message: &quot;ALL OK: there are no studysideMessage(s) on this datasource&quot;.
