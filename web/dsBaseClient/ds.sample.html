<h2>Performs random sampling and permuting of vectors, dataframes and matrices</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>draws a pseudorandom sample from a vector, dataframe or matrix
on the serverside
or - as a special case - randomly permutes a vector, dataframe or matrix.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
ds.sample(
  x = NULL,
  size = NULL,
  seed.as.integer = NULL,
  replace = FALSE,
  prob = NULL,
  newobj = NULL,
  datasources = NULL,
  notify.of.progress = FALSE
)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>Either a character string providing the name for the serverside
vector, matrix or data.frame to be sampled or permuted, or an integer/numeric
scalar (e.g. 923) indicating that one should create a new vector on the serverside
that is a randomly permuted sample of the vector 1:923, or (if [replace]
= FALSE, a full random permutation of that same vector. For further details
of using ds.sample with x set as an integer/numeric please see help for
the sample function in native R. But if x is set as a character string
denoting a vector, matrix or data.frame on the serverside, please note
that although ds.sample effectively calls sample on the serverside
it behaves somewhat differently to sample - for the reasons identified
at the top of 'details' and so help for sample should be used as a guide
only.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>size</code></td>
<td>
<p>a numeric/integer scalar indicating the size of the sample to
be drawn. If the [x] argument is a vector, matrix or data.frame on the
serverside and if the [size] argument is set either to 0 or to the length of
the object to be 'sampled' and [replace] is FALSE, then ds.sample will
draw a random sample that includes all rows of the input object but will randomly
permute them. If the [x] argument is numeric (e.g. 923) and size is either undefined
or set equal to 923, the output on the serverside will be a vector of length 923
permuted into a random order. If the [replace] argument is FALSE then the value
of [size] must be no greater than the length of object to be sorted - if
this is violated an error message will be returned.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>seed.as.integer</code></td>
<td>
<p>this is precisely equivalent to the [seed.as.integer]
arguments for the pseudo-random number generating functions (e.g.
also see help for ds.rBinom, ds.rNorm, ds.rPois and ds.rUnif).
In other words the seed.as.integer argument is either a a numeric scalar
or a NULL which primes the random seed
in each data source. If &lt;seed.as.integer&gt; is a numeric scalar (e.g. 938)
the seed in each study is set as 938*1 in the first study in the set of
data sources being used, 938*2 in the second, up to 938*N in the Nth study.
If &lt;seed.as.integer&gt; is set as 0 all sources will start with the seed value
0 and all the random number generators will therefore start from the same position.
If you want to use the same starting seed in all studies but do not wish it to
be 0, you can specify a non-zero scalar value for &lt;seed.as.integer&gt; and then
use the &lt;datasources&gt; argument to generate the random number vectors one source at
a time (e.g. ,datasources=default.opals[2] to generate the random vector in source 2).
As an example, if the &lt;seed.as.integer&gt; value is 78326 then the seed
in each source will be set at 78326*1 = 78326 because the vector of datasources
being used in each call to the function will always be of length 1 and so the
source-specific seed multiplier will also be 1. The function ds.rUnif.o
calls the serverside assign function setSeedDS.o to create the random seeds in
each source</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>replace</code></td>
<td>
<p>a Boolean indicator (TRUE or FALSE) specifying whether the
sample should be drawn with or without replacement. Default is FALSE so
the sample is drawn without replacement. For further details see
help for sample in native R.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>prob</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character string containing the name of a numeric vector
of probability weights on the serverside that is associated with each of the
elements of the vector to be sampled enabling the drawing of a sample
with some elements given higher probability of being drawn than others.
For further details see help for sample in native R.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>newobj</code></td>
<td>
<p>This a character string providing a name for the output
data.frame which defaults to 'newobj.sample' if no name is specified.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>datasources</code></td>
<td>
<p>specifies the particular opal object(s) to use. If the &lt;datasources&gt;
argument is not specified the default set of opals will be used. The default opals
are called default.opals and the default can be set using the function
ds.setDefaultOpals. If the &lt;datasources&gt; is to be specified, it should be set without
inverted commas: e.g. datasources=opals.em or datasources=default.opals. If you wish to
apply the function solely to e.g. the second opal server in a set of three,
the argument can be specified as: e.g. datasources=opals.em[2].
If you wish to specify the first and third opal servers in a set you specify:
e.g. datasources=opals.em[c(1,3)]</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>notify.of.progress</code></td>
<td>
<p>specifies if console output should be produce to indicate
progress. The default value for notify.of.progress is FALSE.</p>
</td></tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Clientside function ds.sample calls serverside
assign function sampleDS. Based on the native R function sample() but deals
slightly differently with data.frames and matrices. Specifically the sample()
function in R identifies the length of an object and then samples n components
of that length. But length(data.frame) in native R returns the number of columns
not the number of rows. So if you have a data.frame with 71 rows and 10 columns,
the sample() function will select 10 columns at random, which is often not what
is required. So, ds.sample(x=&quot;data.frame&quot;,size=10) in DataSHIELD will sample
10 rows at random(with or without replacement depending whether the [replace]
argument is TRUE or FALSE, with False being default). If x is a simple vector
or a matrix it is first coerced to a data.frame on the serverside and so is dealt
with in the same way (i.e. random selection of 10 rows). If x is an integer
not expressed as a character string, it is dealt with in exactly the same way
as in native R. That is, if x = 923 and size=117, DataSHIELD will draw a 
random sample in random order of size 117 from the vector 1:923 (i.e.
1, 2, ... ,923) with or without replacement depending whether [replace] is
TRUE or FALSE. If the [x] argument is numeric (e.g. 923) and size is either undefined
or set equal to 923, the output on the serverside will be a vector of length 923
permuted into a random order. If the [x] argument is a vector, matrix or data.frame on the
serverside and if the [size] argument is set either to 0 or to the length of
the object to be 'sampled' and [replace] is FALSE, then ds.sample will
draw a random sample that includes all rows of the input object but will randomly
permute them. This is how ds.sample enables random permuting as well as random
sub-sampling. When a serverside vector, matrix or data.frame is sampled using ds.sample
3 new columns are appended to the right of the output object. These are:
'in.sample', 'ID.seq', and 'sampling.order'. The first of these is set to
1 whenever a row enters the sample and as a QA test, all values in that column
in the output object should be 1. 'ID.seq' is a sequential numeric ID appended to
the right of the object to be sampled during the running of ds.sample that runs from
1 to the length of the object and will be appended even if there is already 
an equivalent sequential ID in the object. The output object is stored in
the same original order as it was before sampling, and so if the first 
four elements of 'ID.seq' are 3,4, 6, 15 ... then it means that rows 1 and 2 were
not included in the random sample, but rows 3, 4 were. Row 5 was not included,
6 was included and rows 7-14 were not etc. The 'sampling.order' vector is
of class numeric and indicates the order in which the rows entered the sample:
1 indicates the first row sample, 2 the second etc. The lines of code that follow
create an output object of the same length as the input object (PRWa)
but they join the sample in random order. By sorting the output object (in this
case with the default name 'newobj.sample) using ds.dataFrameSort with the
'sampling.order' vector as the sort key, the output object is rendered
equivalent to PRWa but with the rows randomly permuted (so the column reflecting
the vector 'sample.order' now runs from 1:length of obejct, while the
column reflecting 'ID.seq' denoting the original order is now randomly ordered.
If you need to return to the original order you can simply us ds.dataFrameSort
again using the column reflecting 'ID.seq' as the sort key:
(1) ds.sample('PRWa',size=0,seed.as.integer = 256);
(2) ds.make(&quot;newobj.sample$sampling.order&quot;,&quot;sortkey&quot;);
(3) ds.dataFrameSort(&quot;newobj.sample&quot;,&quot;sortkey&quot;,newobj=&quot;newobj.permuted&quot;)
The only additional detail to note is that the original name of the sort key
(&quot;newobj.sample$sampling.order&quot;) is 28 characters long, and because its
length is tested to check for disclosure risk, this original name will
fail using the usual value for 'nfilter.stringShort' (i.e. 20). This is
why line 2 is inserted to create a copy with a shorter name.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>the object specified by the &lt;newobj&gt; argument (or default name
'newobj.sample')
which is written to the serverside. In addition, two validity messages are returned
indicating whether &lt;newobj&gt; has been created in each data source and if so whether
it is in a valid form. If its form is not valid in at least one study - e.g. because
a disclosure trap was tripped and creation of the full output object was blocked -
ds.dataFrameSort() also returns any studysideMessages that may explain the error in creating
the full output object. We are currently working to extend the information that can
be returned to the clientside when an error occurs.
