<h2>Generates 1-dimensional contingency tables</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The function ds.table1D is a client-side wrapper function.
It calls the server-side subfunction table1dDS to generate
1-dimensional tables for all data sources.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
ds.table1D(x = NULL, type = "combine", datasources = NULL)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character, the name of a numerical vector with
discrete values - usually a factor as well as the tables
representing only the valid data. If TRUE then only
outputs the valid data.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>type</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character which represent the type of graph
to display. If <code>type</code> is set to 'combine', a
histogram that merges the single plot is displayed. Each
histogram is plotted separately if If <code>type</code> is set
to 'split'.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>datasources</code></td>
<td>
<p>a list of opal object(s) obtained
after login in to opal servers; these objects hold also
the data assign to R, as <code>dataframe</code>, from opal
datasources.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Valid (non-disclosive) data are defined as data from
sources where no table cells have counts between 1 and the
minimal number agreed by the data owner. This threshold
(e.g. 5) can in principle be changed but only by amended
the underlying function installed on the data owner server-
hence out of reach of the standard DataSHIELD user). If the
count in any cell in the table produced by a given data
source is invalid, that cell count is changed to &quot;-1&quot; and
the name of the category in which it falls is changed to
'-9'. To avoid infering that invalid count from the rest of
the cells the total count same row and the same columns are
also blanked out by setting them to -1. Each source is
flagged of the row and column of the cell invalid is also
changed to -1. The function ds.table1D prints out tables of
study against x category detailing: counts; column
percents; row percents; and global percents. The final
column represents all valid studies combined. Missing data
are treated as na.action=na.omit (default for table
function), if missing data are to be treated as a separate
and visible category, the variable should first be
transformed to convert NAs to the a new value.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list object (e.g. named out.obj) containing the following
items: </p>
<table summary="R valueblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>OPALS.DATA.OVERVIEW</code></td>
<td>
<p> For each study contains
$study.name (ie name of study), $is.table.valid (TRUE if
all cells valid otherwise FALSE), $safe.table (the safe
contingency table that contains all cells if all are valid,
but otherwise obscures invalid cells by outputting a cell
count of '-1' and making the two category indicators for
that cell = '-9'. In other words OPALS.DATA.OVERVIEW
provides the information generated by the server side
subfunction table1dDS on its own.</p>
</td></tr> <tr valign="top"><td><code>VALIDITY.WARNING -
IF NEEDED</code></td>
<td>
<p>Either reports that all studies are valid, or
else lists the studies that contain at least one cell that
is invalid, or else reports &quot;NO STUDIES HAVE VALID DATA -
SO NO ATTEMPT TO COMBINE&quot;</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>TABLES.VALID.DATA.COUNTS</code></td>
<td>
<p>Cell counts, for each study
separately and for all valid studies combined</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>TABLES.VALID.DATA.COLUMN.PERCENTS</code></td>
<td>
<p>Column percents,
for each study separately and for all valid studies
combined</p>
</td></tr> <tr valign="top"><td><code>TABLES.VALID.DATA.ROW.PERCENTS</code></td>
<td>
<p>Row
percents, for each study separately and for all valid
studies combined</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>TABLES.VALID.DATA.GLOBAL.PERCENTS</code></td>
<td>
<p>Global percents,
for each study separately and for all valid studies
combined</p>
</td></tr>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre>
{

# load the file that contains the login details
data(logindata)

# login and assign the required variables to R
myvar  &lt;-  list('DIS_CVA','LAB_HDL')
opals  &lt;-  datashield.login(logins=logindata,assign=TRUE,variables=myvar)

# Example 1: generate a one dimensional table, outputting combined contingency tables
ds.table1D(x='D$DIS_CVA')

# Example 2: generate a one dimensional table, outputting study specific contingency tables
ds.table1D(x='D$DIS_CVA', type='split')

# Example 3: generate a one dimensional table, outputting study specific and combined
# contingency tables, see what happens if you try to tabulate a quantitative variable
# with unique values for many individuals. The standard \code{table} function in R would
# print out all observed 'values' as category names in ascending order with a count
# (generally 1) for each unique number, but ds.table1D prints out all values where there
# are between 1 and 4 observations as -1 and gives the category name -9. It is only when
# the count is 5 or more that the actual value can be observed, and then it is non-disclosive
ds.table1D(x='D$LAB_HDL')

# clear the Datashield R sessions and logout
datashield.logout(opals)
