<h2>ds.table calling aggregate functions tableDS and tableDS2
and assign function tableDS.assign</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>creates 1-dimensional, 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional
tables using the table function in native R.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
ds.table(
  rvar = NULL,
  cvar = NULL,
  stvar = NULL,
  report.chisq.tests = FALSE,
  exclude = NULL,
  useNA = c("ifany"),
  suppress.chisq.warnings = FALSE,
  table.assign = FALSE,
  newobj = NULL,
  datasources = NULL,
  force.nfilter = NULL
)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>rvar</code></td>
<td>
<p>is a character string (in inverted commas) specifiying the
name of the variable defining the rows in all of the 2 dimensional
tables that form the output. Please see 'details' above for more
information about one-dimensional tables when a variable name is provided
by &lt;rvar&gt; but &lt;cvar&gt; and &lt;stvar&gt; are both NULL</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>cvar</code></td>
<td>
<p>is a character string specifiying the
name of the variable defining the columns in all of the 2 dimensional
tables that form the output.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>stvar</code></td>
<td>
<p>is a character string specifiying the
name of the variable that indexes the separate two dimensional
tables in the output if the call specifies a 3 dimensional table.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>report.chisq.tests</code></td>
<td>
<p>if TRUE, chisquared tests
are applied to every 2 dimensional table in the output and reported
as &quot;chisq.test_table.name&quot;. Default = FALSE.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>exclude</code></td>
<td>
<p>this argument is passed through to the table function in
native R which is called by tableDS. The help for table in native R
indicates that 'exclude' specifies any levels that should be deleted for
all factors in rvar, cvar or stvar. If the &lt;exclude&gt; argument
does not include NA and if the &lt;useNA&gt; argument is not specified,
it implies &lt;useNA&gt; = &quot;ifany&quot;. If you read the help for table in native R
including the 'details' and the 'examples' (particularly 'd.patho') you
will see that the response of table to different combinations of the
&lt;exclude&gt; and &lt;useNA&gt; arguments can be non-intuitive. This is particularly
so if there is more than one type of missing (eg. missing by observation
as well as missing because of an NaN response to a mathematical
function - such as log(-3.0)). In DataSHIELD, if you are in one
of these complex settings (which should not be very common) and
you cannot interpret the output that has been approached
you might try: (1) making sure that the variable producing the strange results
is of class factor rather than integer or numeric - although integers and
numerics are coerced to factors by ds.table they can occasionally behave less
well when the NA setting is complex; (2) specify both an &lt;exclude&gt; argument
e.g. exclude =c(&quot;NaN&quot;,&quot;3&quot;) and a &lt;useNA&gt; argument e.g. useNA= &quot;no&quot;;
(3) if you are excluding multiple levels e.g exclude = c(&quot;NA&quot;,&quot;3&quot;)
then you can reduce this to one e.g. exclude= c(&quot;NA&quot;) and then remove
the 3s by deleting rows of data, or converting the 3s to a different value.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>useNA</code></td>
<td>
<p>this argument is passed through to the table function in
native R which is called by tableDS. The help for table in native R
indicates that it specifies whether to include NA values in the table.
For further information, please see the help for the &lt;exclude&gt; argument (above)
and/or the help for the table function in native R.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>suppress.chisq.warnings</code></td>
<td>
<p>if set to TRUE, the default warnings are
suppressed that would otherwise be produced by the table function in
native R whenever an expected cell count in one or more cells is less than 5.
Default is FALSE. Further details can be found under 'details' and the
help provided for the &lt;report.chisq.tests&gt; argument (above).</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>table.assign</code></td>
<td>
<p>is a Boolean argument set by default to FALSE. If it is
FALSE the ds.table function acts as a standard aggregate function -
it returns the table that is specified in its call to the clientside
where it can be visualised and worked with by the analyst. But if
&lt;table.assign&gt; is TRUE, the same table object is also written to
the serverside. As explained under 'details' (above), this may be
useful when some elements of a table need to be used to drive forward the
overall analysis (e.g. to help select individuals for an analysis
sub-sample), but the required table cannot be visualised or returned
to the clientside because it fails disclosure rules.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>newobj</code></td>
<td>
<p>this a character string providing a name for the output
table object to be written to the serverside if &lt;table.assign&gt; is TRUE.
If no explicit name for the table object is specified, but &lt;table.assign&gt;
is nevertheless TRUE, the name for the serverside table object defaults
to 'newObj'.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>datasources</code></td>
<td>
<p>a list of <code>DSConnection-class</code> objects obtained after login. If the &lt;datasources&gt;
the default set of connections will be used: see datashield.connections_default.
If the &lt;datasources&gt; is to be specified, it should be set without
inverted commas: e.g. datasources=connections.em or datasources=default.connections. If you wish to
apply the function solely to e.g. the second connection server in a set of three,
the argument can be specified as: e.g. datasources=connections.em[2].
If you wish to specify the first and third connection servers in a set you specify:
e.g. datasources=connections.em[c(1,3)].</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>force.nfilter</code></td>
<td>
<p>if &lt;force.nfilter&gt; is non-NULL it must be specified as
a positive integer represented as a character string: e.g. &quot;173&quot;. This
the has the effect of the standard value of 'nfilter.tab' (often 1, 3, 5 or 10
depending what value the data custodian has selected for this particular
data set), to this new value (here, 173). CRUCIALLY, the ds.table function
only allows the standard value to be INCREASED. So if the standard value has
been set as 5 (as one of the R options set in the serverside connection), &quot;6&quot; and
&quot;4981&quot; would be allowable values for the &lt;force.nfilter&gt; argument but &quot;4&quot; or
&quot;1&quot; would not. The purpose of this argument is for the user or developer
to force the table to fail the disclosure control tests so the he/she can
see what then happens and check that it is behaving as anticipated/hoped.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>the ds.table function selects numeric, integer or factor
variables on the serverside which define a contingency table with up to
three dimensions. The native R table function basically operates on
factors and if variables are specified that are integers or numerics
they are first coerced to factors. If the 1-dimensional, 2-dimensional or
3-dimensional table generated from a given study satisfies appropriate
disclosure-control criteria it can be returned directly to
the clientside where it is presented as a study-specific
table and is also included in a combined table across all studies.
</p>
<p>The data custodian responsible for data security in a
given study can specify the minimum non-zero cell count that
determines whether the disclosure-control criterion can be viewed
as having been met. If the count in any one cell in a table falls
below the specified threshold (and is also non-zero)
the whole table is blocked and cannot be returned
to the clientside. However, even if a table is potentially
disclosive it can still be written to the serverside while
an empty representation of the structure of the table is returned
to the clientside. The contents of the cells in the serverside table
object are reflected in a vector of counts which is one component of
that table object.
</p>
<p>The true counts in the studyside vector
are replaced by a sequential set of cell-IDs running from 1:n
(where n is the total number of cells in the table) in the empty
representation of the structure of the potentially disclosive table 
that is returned to the clientside. These cell-IDs reflect
the order of the counts in the true counts vector on the serverside.
In consequence, if the number 13 appears in a cell of the empty
table returned to the clientside, it means that the true count
in that same cell is held as the 13th element of the true count
vector saved on the serverside. This means that a data analyst
can still make use of the counts from a call to the ds.table
function to drive their ongoing analysis even when one or
more non-zero cell counts fall below the specified threshold
for potential disclosure risk. 
</p>
<p>Because the table object on the
serverside cannot be visualised or transferred to the clientside,
DataSHIELD ensures that although it can, in this way, be used
to advance analysis, it does not create a direct risk of disclosure.
</p>
<p>The &lt;rvar&gt; argument identifies the variable defining the rows
in each of the 2 dimensional tables produced in the output.  
</p>
<p>The &lt;cvar&gt;
argument identifies the variable defining the columns in the 2 dimensional
tables produced in the output. 
</p>
<p>In creating a 3-dimensional table the
&lt;stvar&gt; ('separate tables') argument identifies the variable that
indexes the set of two dimensional tables in the output ds.table.
</p>
<p>As a minor technicality, it should be noted that
if a 1-dimensional table is required, one only need specify a value
for the &lt;rvar&gt; argument and any one dimensional table in the output
is presented as a row vectors and so technically the &lt;rvar&gt; variable
defines the columns in that 1 x n vector. However, the ds.table
function deals with 1-dimensional tables differently to 2 and 3
dimensional tables and key components  of the output
for one dimensional tables are actually two dimensional: with
rows defined by &lt;rvar&gt; and with one column for each of the studies.
</p>
<p>The output list generated by ds.table contains tables based on counts
named &quot;table.name_counts&quot; and other tables reporting corresponding
column proportions (&quot;table.name_col.props&quot;) or row proportions
(&quot;table.name_row.props&quot;). In one dimensional tables in the output the
output tables include _counts and _proportions. The latter are not
called _col.props or _row.props because, for the reasons noted
above, they are technically column proportions but are based on the
distribution of the &lt;rvar&gt; variable.
</p>
<p>If the &lt;report.chisq.tests&gt; argument is set to TRUE, chisq tests
are applied to every 2 dimensional table in the output and reported
as &quot;chisq.test_table.name&quot;. The &lt;report.chisq.tests&gt; argument
defaults to FALSE. 
</p>
<p>If there is at least one expected cell
counts &lt; 5 in an output table, the native R &lt;chisq.test&gt; function
returns a warning. Because in a DataSHIELD setting this often means that
every study and several tables may return the same warning
and because it is debatable whether this warning is really
statistically important, the &lt;suppress.chisq.warnings&gt; argument
can be set to TRUE to block the warnings. However, it is defaulted to FALSE.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Having created the requested table based on serverside data
it is returned to the clientside for the analyst to visualise (unless
it is blocked because it fails the disclosure control criteria or
there is an error for some other reason). 
</p>
<p>The clientside output from
ds.table includes error messages that identify when the creation of a
table from a particular study has failed and why. If table.assign=TRUE,
ds.table also writes the requested table as an object named by
the &lt;newobj&gt; argument or set to 'newObj' by default. 
</p>
<p>Further information
about the visible material passed to the clientside, and the optional
table object written to the serverside can be seen under 'details' (above).
