<h2>ds.rbind calling rbindDS</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Take a sequence of vector, matrix or data-frame arguments
and combine them by row to produce a matrix.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
ds.rbind(
  x = NULL,
  DataSHIELD.checks = FALSE,
  force.colnames = NULL,
  newobj = NULL,
  datasources = NULL,
  notify.of.progress = FALSE
)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>This is a vector of character strings representing the names of the elemental
components to be combined.  For example, the call:
ds.rbind(x=c('matrix.m','matrix.n'),newobj='rbind_output') will
stack matrix.m on top of matrix.n provided the number of
columns of matrix.m and matrix.n are the same. The output
object rbind_output is written to the serverside. As many
elemental components as needed may be combined using ds.rbind
provided they all have the same number of columns.
For convenience the x argument can alternatively
be specified in a two step procedure, the first being a call to
the native R environment on the client server:
x.components&lt;-c('matrix.m','matrix.n') then 
ds.rbind(x=x.components,newobj='rbind_output'). Column names
are taken either from the column names of the first object
specified in the &lt;x&gt; argument. Alternatively new column names
can be user specified using &lt;force.colnames&gt;</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>DataSHIELD.checks</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical, if TRUE checks are made that all
input objects exist and are of an appropriate class. These checks
are relatively slow and so the &lt;DataSHIELD.checks&gt; argument is
defaulted to FALSE</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>force.colnames</code></td>
<td>
<p>NULL or a vector of character strings representing
the required column names of the output object. For example:
force.colnames=c(&quot;colname1&quot;,&quot;name.of.second.column&quot;, &quot;lastcol&quot;) for an
output object with three columns. If &lt;force.colnames&gt; is NULL
column names are inferred from the names or column names of
the first object specified in the &lt;x&gt; argument.
The vector of column names must have
the same number of elements as there are columns in the output
object. In other words as every specified object in the &lt;x&gt;
argument must have the same number of columns the vector
of column names must have the same number of elements as
there are columns in every object specified in the &lt;x&gt; argument
If the length of the column name vector is incorrect a
studysideMessage is returned: &quot;Number of column names
does not match number of columns in output object. Here 'N' names
are required.Please see help for ds.rbind function&quot; where 'N'
is the actual number of columns in the output object</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>newobj</code></td>
<td>
<p>This a character string providing a name for the output
data.frame which defaults to 'rbind.newobj' if no name is specified.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>datasources</code></td>
<td>
<p>specifies the particular opal object(s) to use. If the &lt;datasources&gt;
argument is not specified the default set of opals will be used. The default opals
are called default.opals and the default can be set using the function
ds.setDefaultOpals. If the &lt;datasources&gt; is to be specified, it should be set without
inverted commas: e.g. datasources=opals.em or datasources=default.opals. If you wish to
apply the function solely to e.g. the second opal server in a set of three,
the argument can be specified as: e.g. datasources=opals.em[2].
If you wish to specify the first and third opal servers in a set you specify:
e.g. datasources=opals.em[c(1,3)]</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>notify.of.progress</code></td>
<td>
<p>specifies if console output should be produce to indicate
progress. The default value for notify.of.progress is FALSE.</p>
</td></tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A sequence of vector, matrix or data-frame arguments
is combined row by row to produce a matrix
which is written to the serverside. For more details see 
the native R function rbind. The handling of argument &lt;x&gt;
is similar to that of functions ds.cbind and ds.dataFrame
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>the object specified by the &lt;newobj&gt; argument (or default name &lt;rbind.out&gt;).
which is written to the serverside. Unlike the ds.cbind function
even if one of the objects specified in the &lt;x&gt; argument is a data.frame
the output object will always be of class matrix
As well as writing the output object as &lt;newobj&gt;
on the serverside, two validity messages are returned
indicating whether &lt;newobj&gt; has been created in each data source and if so whether
it is in a valid form. If its form is not valid in at least one study - e.g. because
a disclosure trap was tripped and creation of the full output object was blocked -
ds.cbind() also returns any studysideMessages that can explain the error in creating
the full output object. As well as appearing on the screen at run time,if you wish to
see the relevant studysideMessages at a later date you can use the ds.message
function. If you type ds.message(&quot;&lt;newobj&gt;&quot;) it will print out the relevant
studysideMessage from any datasource in which there was an error in creating &lt;newobj&gt;
and a studysideMessage was saved. If there was no error and &lt;newobj&gt; was created
without problems no studysideMessage will have been saved and ds.message(&quot;&lt;newobj&gt;&quot;)
will return the message: &quot;ALL OK: there are no studysideMessage(s) on this datasource&quot;.
