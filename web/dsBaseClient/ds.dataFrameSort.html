<h2>ds.dataFrameSort calling dataFrameSortDS</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Sorts a data frame using a specified sort key
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
ds.dataFrameSort(
  df.name = NULL,
  sort.key.name = NULL,
  sort.descending = FALSE,
  sort.alphabetic = FALSE,
  sort.numeric = FALSE,
  newobj = NULL,
  datasources = NULL
)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>df.name</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character string providing the name for the data.frame
to be sorted</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>sort.key.name</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character string providing the name for the sort key</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>sort.descending</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical, if TRUE the data.frame will be sorted
by the sort key in descending order. Default = FALSE (sort order ascending)</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>sort.alphabetic</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical, if TRUE the sort key is treated as if alphabetic
Default=FALSE.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>sort.numeric</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical, if TRUE the sort key is treated as if numeric
Default=FALSE.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>newobj</code></td>
<td>
<p>This a character string providing a name for the output
data.frame which defaults to 'dataframesort.newobj' if no name is specified</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>datasources</code></td>
<td>
<p>specifies the particular opal object(s) to use. If the &lt;datasources&gt;
argument is not specified the default set of opals will be used. The default opals
are called default.opals and the default can be set using the function
ds.setDefaultOpals. If the &lt;datasources&gt; is to be specified, it should be set without
inverted commas: e.g. datasources=opals.em or datasources=default.opals. If you wish to
apply the function solely to e.g. the second opal server in a set of three,
the argument can be specified as: e.g. datasources=opals.em[2].
If you wish to specify the first and third opal servers in a set you specify:
e.g. datasources=opals.em[c(1,3)]</p>
</td></tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A data frame is a list of variables all with the same number of rows,
which is of class 'data.frame'. ds.dataFrameSort will sort a specified
data.frame on the serverside using a sort key also on the serverside. The
sort key can either sit in the data.frame or outside it. The sort key
can be forced to be interpreted as either alphabetic or numeric
but not both. If neither interpretation is forced, the sort.key will
interpreted naturally: as numeric if it is numeric, otherwise as alphabetic
ie as if it is a vector of character strings.
</p>
<p>It should be noted that although we are all well used to seeing numbers
sorted numerically, and character strings (words) sorted alphabetically
when a numeric vector is sorted alphabetically, the order can look confusing.
It is worth mentioning this because Opal sometimes sorts its data tables
alphabetically using ID. This can be confusing and one of the reasons for
using the ds.dataFrameSort() function is to re-sort a data.frame derived
from an Opal data table so its order is more natural. To explain alphabetic
and numeric sorting further, here are some illustrations.
SORTING NUMBERS:
vector.2.sort = (-192   76  841   NA 1670  163  147  101 -112 -231   -9  119  112   NA)
numeric.sort = (-231 -192 -112   -9   76  101  112  119  147  163  841 1670   NA   NA)
alphabetic.sort = (-112 -192 -231   -9  101  112  119  147  163 1670   76  841   NA   NA)
Notes:
Ascending numeric sorting of a numeric vector orders the values in
naturally increasing manner with negative values first. The positioning of NAs
(missing values) defaults to last.
Ascending alphabetic sorting of a numeric vector treats each number as a word
and then working from the front of the word, sorts all numbers by the first
character of the word, then breaks ties using the second character and so on.
ie as is usual in alphabetic sorting of alphabetic words. The sort order can
look strange in certain settings. (1) If a number is negative, the first character is
'-' which lies ahead of any of the numeric digits in the alphanumeric alphabet. Thus
negative numbers appear first (as in numeric sorting) but the ordering of the
negative numbers is then the opposite way round to expectation. Thus, instead of
the order -231, -192, -112, as in the numeric sort one obtains -112, -192, -231.
This is because these three numbers 'tie' on the first character '-' so are then
sorted on their second characters. The individual numeric digits have the same
alphabetic order as numeric order (0,1,2, ... , 8, 9). This means that having tied
on '-' the numbers with second character '1' come before those with second character
'2'. (2) Under a numeric sorts, and assuming no decimal point or negative sign,
numbers with more digits are of larger magnitude than those with fewer. But under
an alphabetic sort all that matters is the sort order of the first character
that is not tied with the corresponding number in another number.
So the numerically sorted set of numbers 76 841 1670 becomes 1670 76  841
under alphabetic sorting.
SORTING CHARACTER STRINGS (WORDS):
words.2.sort = (&quot;a&quot;  &quot;L&quot;  &quot;p&quot;  &quot;h&quot;  &quot;A&quot;  &quot;&quot;   &quot;nu&quot; &quot;Me&quot; &quot;R&quot;  &quot;IC&quot; &quot;&quot;)
alphabetic.sort = (&quot;&quot;   &quot;&quot;   &quot;a&quot;  &quot;A&quot;  &quot;h&quot;  &quot;IC&quot; &quot;L&quot;  &quot;Me&quot; &quot;nu&quot; &quot;p&quot;  &quot;R&quot;)
There are few surprises here, perhaps the only thing to note is that
missing values (empty strings) get ordered first by default rather than last.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>the object specified by the &lt;newobj&gt; argument (or default name &lt;df.name&gt;.sorted)
which is written to the serverside. In addition, two validity messages are returned
indicating whether &lt;newobj&gt; has been created in each data source and if so whether
it is in a valid form. If its form is not valid in at least one study - e.g. because
a disclosure trap was tripped and creation of the full output object was blocked -
ds.dataFrameSort() also returns any studysideMessages that can explain the error in creating
the full output object. As well as appearing on the screen at run time,if you wish to
see the relevant studysideMessages at a later date you can use the ds.message
function. If you type ds.message(&quot;newobj&quot;) it will print out the relevant
studysideMessage from any datasource in which there was an error in creating &lt;newobj&gt;
and a studysideMessage was saved. If there was no error and &lt;newobj&gt; was created
without problems no studysideMessage will have been saved and ds.message(&quot;newobj&quot;)
will return the message: &quot;ALL OK: there are no studysideMessage(s) on this datasource&quot;.
