<h2>ds.tapply.assign calling tapplyDS.assign</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Apply one of a selected range of functions to summarize an
outcome variable over one or more indexing factors and write the resultant
summary as an object on the serverside
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
ds.tapply.assign(
  X.name = NULL,
  INDEX.names = NULL,
  FUN.name = NULL,
  newobj = NULL,
  datasources = NULL
)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>X.name, </code></td>
<td>
<p>the name of the variable to be summarized. The user must set the name as a
character string in inverted commas. For example: X.name=&quot;var.name&quot;</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>INDEX.names, </code></td>
<td>
<p>the name of a single factor or a vector of names of factors to
index the variable to be summarized. Each name must be specified in inverted commas.
For example: INDEX.names=&quot;factor.name&quot; or
INDEX.names=c(&quot;factor1.name&quot;, &quot;factor2.name&quot;, &quot;factor3.name&quot;). The native R tapply function
can coerce non-factor vectors into factors. However, this does not always work when
using the DataSHIELD ds.tapply/ds.tapply.assign functions so if you are concerned that
an indexing vector is not being treated correctly as a factor,
please first declare it explicitly as a factor using ds.asFactor</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>FUN.name, </code></td>
<td>
<p>the name of one of the allowable summarizing functions to be applied
specified in inverted commas. The present version of the
function allows the user to choose one of five summarizing functions. These are
&quot;N&quot; (or &quot;length&quot;), &quot;mean&quot;,&quot;sd&quot;, &quot;sum&quot;, or &quot;quantile&quot;. For more information see Details.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>newobj</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character string specifying the name of the vector to which the output
vector is to be written. If no &lt;newobj&gt; argument is specified, the output vector defaults
to &quot;tapply.assign.newobj&quot;.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>datasources</code></td>
<td>
<p>specifies the particular opal object(s) to use. If the &lt;datasources&gt;
argument is not specified the default set of opals will be used. The default opals
are called default.opals and the default can be set using the function
ds.setDefaultOpals. If the &lt;datasources&gt; is to be specified, it should be set without
inverted commas: e.g. datasources=opals.em or datasources=default.opals. If you wish to
apply the function solely to e.g. the second opal server in a set of three,
the argument can be specified as: e.g. datasources=opals.em[2].
If you wish to specify the first and third opal servers in a set you specify:
e.g. datasources=opals.em[c(1,3)]</p>
</td></tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A clientside function calling an assign serverside function that uses
the native R function tapply() to apply one of
a selected range of functions to each cell of a ragged array, that is to each (non-empty)
group of values given by each unique combination of a series of indexing factors. The native R
tapply function is very flexible and the range of allowable summarizing functions
is much more restrictive for the DataSHIELD ds.tapply function. This is to protect
against disclosure risk. At present the allowable functions are: N or length (the number
of (non-missing) observations in the group defined by each combination of indexing
factors; mean; SD (standard deviation); sum; quantile (with quantile probabilities set at
c(0.05,0.1,0.2,0.25,0.3,0.33,0.4,0.5,0.6,0.67,0.7,0.75,0.8,0.9,0.95). Should other functions
be required in the future then, provided they are non-disclosive, the DataSHIELD development
team could work on them if requested. As an assign function tapplyDS.assign
writes the summarized values to the serverside. Because unlike the aggregate function
tapplyDS, tapply.assign returns no results to the clientside, it is fundamentally
non-disclosive and the number of observations in each unique indexing group does
not need to be evaluated against nfilter.tab (the minimum allowable non-zero count
in a contingency table). This means that tapplyDS.assign can be used, for example, 
to break a dataset down into a small number of values for each individual and then to flag up
which individuals have got at least one positive value for a binary outcome variable.
This will almost inevitably generate some indexing groups smaller than nfilter.tab but
as the results are simply written as newobj to the serverside rather than returned to
the clientside there is no overt disclosure risk. The native R
tapply function has optional arguments such as na.rm=TRUE for FUN = mean which will
exclude any NAs from the outcome variable to be summarized. However, in order to keep
DataSHIELD's ds.tapply and ds.tapply.assign functions straightforward, the
serverside functions tapplyDS and tapplyDS.assign both start by stripping
any observations which have missing (NA) values in either the outcome variable or in
any one of the indexing factors. In consequence, the resultant analyses are always based
on complete.cases.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>an array of the summarized values created by the tapplyDS.assign function.
This array is written as a newobj onto the serverside. It has the same number of
dimensions as INDEX.
