<h2>ds.seq calling seqDS</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>ds.seq calling assign function seqDS
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
ds.seq(FROM.value.char = "1", BY.value.char = "1",
  LENGTH.OUT.value.char = NULL, ALONG.WITH.name = NULL,
  newobj = "newObj", datasources = NULL)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>FROM.value.char</code></td>
<td>
<p>the starting value for the sequence expressed as an integer
in character form. e.g. FROM.value.char=&quot;1&quot; will start at 1, FROM.value.char=&quot;-10&quot;
will start at -10. Default = &quot;1&quot;</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>BY.value.char</code></td>
<td>
<p>the value to increment each step in the sequence
expressed as a numeric e.g. BY.value.char=&quot;10&quot; will increment by 10,
while BY.value.char=&quot;-3.37&quot; will reduce the value of each sequence
element by -3.37. Default = &quot;1&quot; but does not have to be integer</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>LENGTH.OUT.value.char</code></td>
<td>
<p>The length of the sequence at which point
its extension should be stopped. e.g.  LENGTH.OUT.value.char=&quot;1000&quot; will
generate a sequence of length 1000. Default = NULL (must be specified) but
must be a positive integer</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>ALONG.WITH.name</code></td>
<td>
<p>For convenience, rather than specifying a value
for LENGTH.OUT it can often be better to specify a variable name as
the &lt;ALONG.WITH.name&gt; argument. e.g. ALONG.WITH.name = &quot;vector.name&quot;.
This can be particularly useful in DataSHIELD
where the length of the sequence you need to generate in each data set
depends on the standard length of vectors in that data set and this will
in general vary.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>newobj</code></td>
<td>
<p>This a character string providing a name for the output
sequence vector which defaults to 'newObj' if no name is specified.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>datasources</code></td>
<td>
<p>specifies the particular opal object(s) to use. If the &lt;datasources&gt;
argument is not specified the default set of opals will be used. The default opals
are called default.opals and the default can be set using the function
ds.setDefaultOpals. If the &lt;datasources&gt; is to be specified, it should be set without
inverted commas: e.g. datasources=opals.em or datasources=default.opals. If you wish to
apply the function solely to e.g. the second opal server in a set of three,
the argument can be specified as: e.g. datasources=opals.em[2].
If you wish to specify the first and third opal servers in a set you specify:
e.g. datasources=opals.em[c(1,3)].</p>
</td></tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Calls an assign function that uses the native R function seq() to create
any one of a flexible range of sequence vectors that can then be used to help
manage and analyse data. As it is an assign function the resultant vector is
written as a new object onto all of the specified data source servers. For
the purposes of creating the DataSHIELD equivalent to seq() in native R we
have used all of the original arguments (see below) except the &lt;to&gt; argument.
This simplifies the function and prevents some combinations of arguments that
lead to an error in native R. The effect of the &lt;to&gt; argument - see help(seq) in
native R - is to specify the terminal value of the sequence. However,
when using seq() one can usually specify other arguments (see below) to mimic
the desire effect of &lt;to&gt;. These include: &lt;from&gt;, the starting value of the
sequence; &lt;by&gt;, its increment (+ or -), and &lt;length.out&gt; the length of the final vector
in each data source.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>the object specified by the &lt;newobj&gt; argument (or default name newObj)
which is written to the serverside. 
As well as writing the output object as &lt;newobj&gt;
on the serverside, two validity messages are returned
indicating whether &lt;newobj&gt; has been created in each data source and if so whether
it is in a valid form. If its form is not valid in at least one study - e.g. because
a disclosure trap was tripped and creation of the full output object was blocked -
ds.seq() also returns any studysideMessages that can explain the error in creating
the full output object. As well as appearing on the screen at run time,if you wish to
see the relevant studysideMessages at a later date you can use the ds.message
function. If you type ds.message(&quot;&lt;newobj&gt;&quot;) it will print out the relevant
studysideMessage from any datasource in which there was an error in creating &lt;newobj&gt;
and a studysideMessage was saved. If there was no error and &lt;newobj&gt; was created
without problems no studysideMessage will have been saved and ds.message(&quot;&lt;newobj&gt;&quot;)
will return the message: &quot;ALL OK: there are no studysideMessage(s) on this datasource&quot;.
