<h2>ds.unList calling assign function unListDS</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>this function is based on the native R function unlist
which coerces an object of list class back to the class it was when
it was coerced into a list
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
ds.unList(x.name = NULL, newobj = NULL, datasources = NULL)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>x.name</code></td>
<td>
<p>the name of the input object to be unlisted.
It must be specified in inverted commas e.g. x.name=&quot;input.object.name&quot;</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>newobj</code></td>
<td>
<p>the name of the new output variable. If this argument is set
to NULL, the name of the new variable is defaulted to unlist.newobj</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>datasources</code></td>
<td>
<p>specifies the particular opal object(s) to use. If the &lt;datasources&gt;
argument is not specified the default set of opals will be used. The default opals
are called default.opals and the default can be set using the function
ds.setDefaultOpals.o. If an explicit &lt;datasources&gt; argument is to be set,
it should be specified without
inverted commas: e.g. datasources=opals.em or datasources=default.opals. If you wish to
apply the function solely to e.g. the second opal server in a set of three,
the argument can be specified as: e.g. datasources=opals.em[2].
If you wish to specify the first and third opal servers in a set you specify:
e.g. datasources=opals.em[c(1,3)]</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>See details of the native R function unlist.
This function represents a substantive restructuring of an earlier version
created by Amadou Gaye.
When an object is coerced to a list, depending
on the class of the original object some information may be lost. Thus,
for example, when a data.frame is coerced to a list information that
underpins the structure of the data.frame is lost and when it is
subject to the function ds.unList.o it is returned to a simpler
class than data.frame eg 'numeric' (basically a numeric vector
containing all of the original data in all variables in the data.frame
but with no structure). If you wish to reconstruct the original
data.frame you therefore need to specify this structure again e.g.
the column names etc
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>the object specified by the &lt;newobj&gt; argument (or by default &lt;x.name&gt;.unlist
if the &lt;newobj&gt; argument is NULL) which is written to the serverside.
As well as writing the output object as &lt;newobj&gt;
on the serverside, two validity messages are returned
indicating whether &lt;newobj&gt; has been created in each data source and if so whether
it is in a valid form. If its form is not valid in at least one study - e.g. because
a disclosure trap was tripped and creation of the full output object was blocked -
ds.seq() also returns any studysideMessages that can explain the error in creating
the full output object. As well as appearing on the screen at run time,if you wish to
see the relevant studysideMessages at a later date you can use the ds.message
function. If you type ds.message(&quot;&lt;newobj&gt;&quot;) it will print out the relevant
studysideMessage from any datasource in which there was an error in creating &lt;newobj&gt;
and a studysideMessage was saved. Because the outcome object from ds.unList is
typically a list object with no names, if there are no errors in creating it
the message returned from ds.message(&quot;&lt;newobj&gt;&quot;) in each study will read
&quot;Outcome object is a list without names. So a studysideMessage may be hidden.
Please check output is OK&quot;. This suggests that - in the case of this specific
function - one should check as far as one can
the nature of the output from a call to ds.unList - e.g. ds.class, ds.length etc
