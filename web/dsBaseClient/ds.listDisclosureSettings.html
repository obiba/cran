<h2>Lists disclosure settings</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Lists current values for disclosure control filters in all data repository servers.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
ds.listDisclosureSettings(datasources = NULL)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>datasources</code></td>
<td>
<p>a list of <code>DSConnection-class</code> objects obtained after login. 
If the <code>datasources</code> argument is not specified
the default set of connections will be used: see <code>datashield.connections_default</code>.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function lists out the current values of the eight disclosure filters in each of
the data repository servers specified by <code>datasources</code> argument.<br />
</p>
<p>The eight filters are explained below:
</p>
<p>(1) <code>nfilter.tab</code>, the minimum non-zero cell count allowed in any cell if a contingency table is
to be returned. This applies to one dimensional and two dimensional tables of counts tabulated
across one or two factors and to tables of a mean of a quantitative variable tabulated across a
factor. Default usually set to 3 but a value of 1 (no limit) may be necessary, particularly if
low cell counts are highly probable such as when working with rare diseases. Five is also a
justifiable choice to replicate the most common threshold rule imposed by data releasers
worldwide, but it should be recognised that many census providers are moving to ten - but the
formal justification of this is little more than 'it is safer' and everybody is scared of
something going wrong - in practice it is very easy to get around any block and so it is
debatable whether the scientific cost outweighs the imposition of any threshold.
</p>
<p>(2) <code>nfilter.subset</code>, the minimum non-zero count of observational units (typically individuals) in
a subset. Typically defaulted to 3.
</p>
<p>(3) <code>nfilter.glm</code>, the maximum number of parameters in a regression model as a proportion of the
sample size in a study. If a study has 1000 observational units (typically individuals) being
used in a particular analysis then if <code>nfilter.glm</code> is set to 0.33 (its default value) the maximum
allowable number of parameters in a model fitted to those data will be 330. This disclosure
filter protects against fitting overly saturated models that can be disclosive. The choice of
0.33 is entirely arbitrary.
</p>
<p>(4) <code>nfilter.string</code>, the maximum length of a string argument if that argument is to be subject to
testing of its length. Default value 80. The aim of this <code>nfilter</code> is to make it difficult for
hackers to find a way to embed malicious code in a valid string argument that is actively
interpreted.
</p>
<p>(5) <code>nfilter.string</code>, Short to be used when a string must be specified but that when valid that
string should be short.
</p>
<p>(6) <code>nfilter.kNN</code> applies to graphical plots based on working with the k nearest neighbours of
each point. <code>nfilter.kNN</code> specifies the minimum allowable value for the number of nearest
neighbours used, typically defaulted to 3.
</p>
<p>(7) <code>nfilter.levels</code> specifies the maximum number of unique levels of a factor variable that can
be disclosed to the client. In the absence of this filter a user can convert a numeric variable
to a factor and see its unique levels which are all the distinct values of the numeric vector. To
prevent such disclosure we set this threshold to 0.33 which ensures that if a factor has unique
levels more than the 33
</p>
<p>(8) <code>nfilter.noise</code> specifies the minimum level of noise added in some variables mainly used for
data visualizations. The default value is 0.25 which means that the noise added to a given
variable, follows a normal distribution with zero mean and variance equal to 25
variance of the given variable. Any value greater than this threshold can reduce the risk of
disclosure.

<p>Server function called: <code>listDisclosureSettingsDS</code>
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>ds.listDisclosureSettings</code> returns a list containing the current settings of the
<code>nfilters</code> in each study specified.
