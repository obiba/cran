<h2>Applies a Function Over a Server-Side Ragged Array</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Apply one of a selected range of functions to summarize an
outcome variable over one or more indexing factors. 
The resultant summary is written to the client-side.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
ds.tapply(
  X.name = NULL,
  INDEX.names = NULL,
  FUN.name = NULL,
  datasources = NULL
)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>X.name</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character string specifying the name of the variable to be summarized.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>INDEX.names</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character string specifying the name of a single factor 
or a vector of names of factors to
index the variable to be summarized. 
For more information see <strong>Details</strong>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>FUN.name</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character string specifying the name of one of the allowable 
summarizing functions. This can be set as: 
<code>"N"</code> (or <code>"length"</code>), <code>"mean"</code>,<code>"sd"</code>, <code>"sum"</code>,
or <code>"quantile"</code>. 
For more information see <strong>Details</strong>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>datasources</code></td>
<td>
<p>a list of <code>DSConnection-class</code> 
objects obtained after login. If the <code>datasources</code> argument is not specified
the default set of connections will be used: see <code>datashield.connections_default</code>.</p>
</td></tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function is similar to a native R function <code>tapply()</code>.
It applies one of a selected range of functions to each cell 
of a ragged array, that is to each (non-empty)
group of values given by each unique combination of a series of indexing factors. 
</p>
<p>The range of allowable summarizing functions for DataSHIELD <code>ds.tapply</code> function
is much more restrictive than for the native R <code>tapply</code> function.
The reason for this is the protection against disclosure risk. 
</p>
<p>Should other functions
be required in the future then, provided they are non-disclosive, the DataSHIELD development
team could work on them if requested.
</p>
<p>To protect against disclosure the
number of observations in each summarizing group in each source is calculated
and if any of these falls below the value of <code>nfilter.tab</code> 
(the minimum allowable non-zero count
in a contingency table) the tapply analysis of that source will return only an error message.
The value of <code>nfilter.tab</code> is can be set and modified only by the data custodian. If an
analytic team wishes the value to be reduced (e.g. to 1 which will allow any output
from tapply to be returned) this needs to formally be discussed and agreed
with the data custodian. 
</p>
<p>If the reason for the tapply analysis is, for example, to break
a dataset down into a small number of values for each individual and then to flag up
which individuals have got at least one positive value for a binary outcome variable, then
that flagging does not have to be overtly returned to the client-side. Rather, it can be
written as a vector to the server-side at each source (which, like any other server-side
object, cannot then be seen, abstracted or copied). This can be done using 
<code>ds.tapply.assign</code> which writes the results as a <code>newobj</code> to the server-side 
and does not test the number of observations in each group against <code>nfilter.tab</code>. 
For more information see the help option of <code>ds.tapply.assign</code> function. 
</p>
<p>The native R
tapply function has optional arguments such as <code>na.rm = TRUE</code> for <code>FUN = mean</code>
which will exclude any NAs from the outcome variable to be summarized. 
However, in order to keep DataSHIELD's <code>ds.tapply</code> and <code>ds.tapply.assign</code> 
functions straightforward, the
server-side functions <code>tapplyDS</code> and <code>tapplyDS.assign</code> both starts by stripping
any observations which have missing (NA) values in either the outcome variable or in
any one of the indexing factors. In consequence, the resultant analyses are always based
on complete cases.
</p>
<p>In <code>INDEX.names</code> argument the native R tapply function
can coerce non-factor vectors into factors. However, this does not always work when
using the DataSHIELD <code>ds.tapply</code> or <code>ds.tapply.assign</code> 
functions so if you are concerned that
an indexing vector is not being treated correctly as a factor,
please first declare it explicitly as a factor using <code>ds.asFactor</code>. 
</p>
<p>In <code>FUN.name</code> argument the allowable functions are: N or length (the number
of (non-missing) observations in the group defined by each combination of indexing
factors); mean; SD (standard deviation); sum; quantile (with quantile probabilities set at
c(0.05,0.1,0.2,0.25,0.3,0.33,0.4,0.5,0.6,0.67,0.7,0.75,0.8,0.9,0.95)).
</p>
<p>Server function called: <code>tapplyDS</code>
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>ds.tapply</code> returns to the client-side an array of the summarized values.
It has the same number of dimensions as INDEX.
