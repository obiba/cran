<h2>ds.tapply calling tapplyDS</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Apply one of a selected range of functions to summarize an
outcome variable over one or more indexing factors and write the resultant
summary to the clientside
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
ds.tapply(X.name = NULL, INDEX.names = NULL, FUN.name = NULL,
  datasources = NULL)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>X.name, </code></td>
<td>
<p>the name of the variable to be summarized. The user must set the name as a
character string in inverted commas. For example: X.name=&quot;var.name&quot;</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>INDEX.names, </code></td>
<td>
<p>the name of a single factor or a vector of names of factors to
index the variable to be summarized. Each name must be specified in inverted commas.
For example: INDEX.names=&quot;factor.name&quot; or
INDEX.names=c(&quot;factor1.name&quot;, &quot;factor2.name&quot;, &quot;factor3.name&quot;). The native R tapply function
can coerce non-factor vectors into factors. However, this does not always work when
using the DataSHIELD ds.tapply/ds.tapply.assign functions so if you are concerned that
an indexing vector is not being treated correctly as a factor,
please first declare it explicitly as a factor using ds.asFactor</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>FUN.name, </code></td>
<td>
<p>the name of one of the allowable summarizing functions to be applied
specified in inverted commas. The present version of the
function allows the user to choose one of five summarizing functions. These are
&quot;N&quot; (or &quot;length&quot;), &quot;mean&quot;,&quot;sd&quot;, &quot;sum&quot;, or &quot;quantile&quot;. For more information see Details.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>datasources</code></td>
<td>
<p>specifies the particular opal object(s) to use. If the &lt;datasources&gt;
argument is not specified the default set of opals will be used. The default opals
are called default.opals and the default can be set using the function
ds.setDefaultOpals. If the &lt;datasources&gt; is to be specified, it should be set without
inverted commas: e.g. datasources=opals.em or datasources=default.opals. If you wish to
apply the function solely to e.g. the second opal server in a set of three,
the argument can be specified as: e.g. datasources=opals.em[2].
If you wish to specify the first and third opal servers in a set you specify:
e.g. datasources=opals.em[c(1,3)]</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A clientside function calling an aggregate serverside function that uses
the native R function tapply() to apply one of
a selected range of functions to each cell of a ragged array, that is to each (non-empty)
group of values given by each unique combination of a series of indexing factors. The native R
tapply function is very flexible and the range of allowable summarizing functions
is much more restrictive for the DataSHIELD ds.tapply function. This is to protect
against disclosure risk. At present the allowable functions are: N/length (the number
of (non-missing) observations in the group defined by each combination of indexing
factors; mean; SD (standard deviation); sum; quantile (with quantile probabilities set at
c(0.05,0.1,0.2,0.25,0.3,0.33,0.4,0.5,0.6,0.67,0.7,0.75,0.8,0.9,0.95). Should other functions
be required in the future then, provided they are non-disclosive, the DataSHIELD development
team could work on them if requested. As an aggregate function ds.tapply returns the
summarized values to the clientside. In order to protect against disclosure the 
number of observations in each summarizing group in each source is calculated
and if any of these fall below the value of nfilter.tab (the minimum allowable non-zero count
in a contingency table) the tapply analysis of that source will return only an error message.
The value of nfilter.tab is can be set and modified only by the data custodian. If an
analytic team wish the value to be reduced (e.g. to 1 which will allow any output
from tapply to be returned) this needs to formally be discussed and agreed
with the data custodian. If the reason for the tapply analysis is, for example, to break
a dataset down into a small number of values for each individual and then to flag up
which individuals have got at least one positive value for a binary outcome variable, then
that flagging does not have to be overtly returned to the clientside. Rather, it can be
written as a vector to the serverside at each source (which, like any other serverside
object, cannot then be seen, abstracted or copied). This can be done using ds.tapply.assign
which calls an assign function tapplyDS.assign which acts just like the aggregate
function tapplyDS but it writes the results as a newobj to the serverside and does
not test the number of observations in each group against nfilter.tab. The native R
tapply function has optional arguments such as na.rm=TRUE for FUN = mean which will
exclude any NAs from the outcome variable to be summarized. However, in order to keep
DataSHIELD's ds.tapply and ds.tapply.assign functions straightforward, the
serverside functions tapplyDS and tapplyDS.assign both start by stripping
any observations which have missing (NA) values in either the outcome variable or in
any one of the indexing factors. In consequence, the resultant analyses are always based
on complete.cases.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>an array of the summarized values created by the tapplyDS function. This array
is returned to the clientside. It has the same number of dimensions as INDEX.
