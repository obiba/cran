<h2>ds.dataFrameSubset calling dataFrameSubsetDS1 and dataFrameSubsetDS2</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Subsets a data frame by row or by column.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
ds.dataFrameSubset(
  df.name = NULL,
  V1.name = NULL,
  V2.name = NULL,
  Boolean.operator = NULL,
  keep.cols = NULL,
  rm.cols = NULL,
  keep.NAs = NULL,
  newobj = NULL,
  datasources = NULL,
  notify.of.progress = FALSE
)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>df.name</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character string providing the name for the data.frame
from where the subset is created.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>V1.name</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character string specifying the name of a subsetting vector
to which a Boolean operator will be applied to define the subset to be created. Note
if the plan is to subset by column using ALL rows, then &lt;V1.name&gt;
might, for example, specify a vector consisting all of ones (see 'details' for how
to create such a vector.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>V2.name</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character string specifying the name of the vector
or scalar to which the values in the vector specified by the argument &lt;V1.name&gt;
is to be compared. So, for example, if &lt;V2.name&gt;
is a scalar (e.g. '4')
and the &lt;Boolean.operator&gt; argument is '&lt;=', the subset data.frame that is created
will include all rows that correspond to a value of 4 or less in the subsetting
vector specified by the &lt;V1.name&gt; argument. If &lt;V2.name&gt; specifies a vector
(which must be of strictly the same length as the vector specified by &lt;V1.name&gt;)
and the &lt;Boolean.operator&gt; argument is '==', the subset data.frame that is
created will include
all rows in which the values in the vectors specified by &lt;V1.name&gt; and &lt;V2.name&gt;
are equal. If you are subsetting by column and want to keep all rows in the final subset,
&lt;V1.name&gt; can be specified as indicating a &quot;ONES&quot; vector created as described (above)
under 'details', &lt;V2.name&gt; can be specified as the scalar &quot;1&quot; and the &lt;Boolean operator&gt;
argument can be specified as &quot;==&quot;</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>Boolean.operator</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character string specifying one of six possible Boolean operators:
'==', '!=', '&gt;', '&gt;=', '&lt;', '&lt;='</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>keep.cols</code></td>
<td>
<p>a numeric vector specifying the numbers of the columns to be kept in the
final subset when subsetting by column. For example: keep.cols=c(2:5,7,12) will keep
columns 2,3,4,5,7 and 12.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>rm.cols</code></td>
<td>
<p>a numeric vector specifying the numbers of the columns to be removed before
creating the final subset when subsetting by column. For example: rm.cols=c(2:5,7,12)
will remove columns 2,3,4,5,7 and 12.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>keep.NAs</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical, if TRUE any NAs in the vector holding the final Boolean vector
indicating whether a given row should be included in the subset will be converted into
1s and so they will be included in the subset. Such NAs could be caused by NAs in
either &lt;V1.name&gt; or &lt;V2.name&gt;. If FALSE or NULL NAs in the final Boolean vector will
be converted to 0s and the corresponding row will therefore be excluded from the subset.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>newobj</code></td>
<td>
<p>This a character string providing a name for the subset
data.frame representing the primary output of the ds.dataFrameSubset() function.
This defaults to 'dataframesubset.newobj' if no name is specified</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>datasources</code></td>
<td>
<p>specifies the particular opal object(s) to use. If the &lt;datasources&gt;
argument is not specified the default set of opals will be used. The default opals
are called default.opals and the default can be set using the function
ds.setDefaultOpals. If the &lt;datasources&gt; is to be specified, it should be set without
inverted commas: e.g. datasources=opals.em or datasources=default.opals. If you wish to
apply the function solely to e.g. the second opal server in a set of three,
the argument can be specified as: e.g. datasources=opals.em[2].
If you wish to specify the first and third opal servers in a set you specify:
e.g. datasources=opals.em[c(1,3)]</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>notify.of.progress</code></td>
<td>
<p>specifies if console output should be produce to indicate
progress. The default value for notify.of.progress is FALSE.</p>
</td></tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A data frame is a list of variables all with the same number of rows,
which is of class 'data.frame'. ds.dataFrameSubset will subset a 
pre-existing data.frame by specifying the values of a subsetting variable
(subsetting by row) or by selecting columns to keep or remove (subsetting
by column). When subsetting by row, the resultant subset must strictly be
as large or larger than the disclosure trap value nfilter.subset. If you
wish to keep all rows in the subset (e.g. if the primary plan is to subset by column
not by row) then V1.name can be used to specify a vector of the same length
as the data.frame to be subsetted in each study in which every
element is 1 and there are no NAs. Such a vector can be created as follows:
First identify a convenient numeric variable with no missing values (typically a numeric
individual ID) let us call it indID, which is equal in length to the data.frame
to be subsetted. Then use the ds.make() function with the call
ds.make('indID-indID+1','ONES'). This creates a vector of ones (called 'ONES')
in each source equal in length to the indID vector in that source.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>the object specified by the &lt;newobj&gt; argument (or default name '&lt;df.name&gt;_subset').
which is written to the serverside. In addition, two validity messages are returned
indicating whether &lt;newobj&gt; has been created in each data source and if so whether
it is in a valid form. If its form is not valid in at least one study - e.g. because
a disclosure trap was tripped and creation of the full output object was blocked -
ds.dataFrame() also returns any studysideMessages that can explain the error in creating
the full output object. As well as appearing on the screen at run time,if you wish to
see the relevant studysideMessages at a later date you can use the ds.message
function. If you type ds.message(&quot;newobj&quot;) it will print out the relevant
studysideMessage from any datasource in which there was an error in creating &lt;newobj&gt;
and a studysideMessage was saved. If there was no error and &lt;newobj&gt; was created
without problems no studysideMessage will have been saved and ds.message(&quot;newobj&quot;)
will return the message: &quot;ALL OK: there are no studysideMessage(s) on this datasource&quot;.
