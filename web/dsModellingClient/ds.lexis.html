<h2>Generates an expanded version of a dataset that contains survival data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function is meant to be used as part of a piecewise
regression analysis.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
ds.lexis(data = NULL, intervalWidth = NULL, idCol = NULL,
  entryCol = NULL, exitCol = NULL, statusCol = NULL, variables = NULL,
  newobj = NULL, datasources = NULL)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character, the name of the table that holds
the original data, this is the data to be expanded.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>intervalWidth,</code></td>
<td>
<p>a numeric vector which gives the
chosen width of the intervals ('pieces'). This can be one
value (in which case all the intervals have same width)
or several different values. If no value(s) are provided
a single default value is used. That default value is the
set to be the 1/10th of the mean of the exit time values
across all the studies.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>idCol</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character the name of the column that
holds the individual IDs of the subjects.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>entryCol</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character, the name of the column that
holds the entry times (i.e. start of follow up). If no
name is provided the default is to set all the entry
times to 0 in a column named &quot;STARTTIME&quot;. A message is
then printed to alert the user as this has serious
consequences if the actual entry times are not 0 for all
the subjects.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>exitCol</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character, the name of the column that
holds the exit times (i.e. end of follow up).</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>statusCol</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character, the name of the column that
holds the 'failure' status of each subject, tells whether
or not a subject has been censored.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>variables</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character vector, the column names of
the variables (covariates) to include in the final
expanded table. The input table might have a large number
of covariates and if only some of those variables are
relevant for the sought analysis it make sense to only
include those. By default (i.e. if no variables are
indicated) all the covariates in the inout table are
included and this will lengthen the run time of the
function.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>newobj</code></td>
<td>
<p>the name of the output expanded table. By
default the name is the name of the input table with the
suffixe &quot;_expanded&quot;.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>datasources</code></td>
<td>
<p>a list of opal object(s) obtained
after login to opal servers; these objects also hold the
data assigned to R, as a <code>data frame</code>, from opal
datasources</p>
</td></tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>It splits the survial interval time of subjects into
sub-intervals and reports the failure status of the
subjects at each sub-interval. Each of those sub-interval
is given an id e.g. if the overall interval of a subject is
split into 4 sub-interval, those sub-intervals have ids 1,
2, 3 and 4; so this is basically the count of periods for
each subject. The interval ids are held in a column named
&quot;TIMEID&quot;. The entry and exit times in the input table are
used to compute the total survival time. By default all the
covariates in the input table are included in the expanded
output table but it is preferable to indicate the names of
the covariates to be included via the argument 'variables'.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a dataframe, an expanded version of the input table.

  # load the file that contains the login details

  # login and assign all the variables to R
  opals &lt;- datashield.login(logins=survivalLoginData,assign=TRUE)

  # this example shows how to run survival analysis in H-DataSHIELD using the 'piecewise exponential regression' method

  # let us display the names of the variables in the original table (the table we assigned above and which by default is named 'D')
  ds.colnames('D')

  # specify some baseline hazard profile (i.e. the width of the intervals to be used)
  bh &lt;- c(2,1,3,0.5,1.5,2)

  # expand the original table (e.g the survial time of each individual is split into 'pieces' equal to the intervals specified above
  # we use the function 'ds.lexis' which expands the original table and saves the expanded table on the server site.
  # we set the parameter 'variables' to NULL (default) which means include all the covariates in the expanded table - It is preferable
  # to indicate the variables to include if you have many variables and wants to use only a subset of those.
  ds.lexis(data='D', intervalWidth=bh, idCol="ID", entryCol="STARTTIME", exitCol="ENDTIME", statusCol="CENS")

  # let us display the names of variables in the expanded table (by default it is the name of the priginal table followed by '_expanded')
  ds.colnames('D_expanded')

  # Now fit a GLM with a poisson model
  # there is a direct relationship between the poisson model with a log-time offset and the exponential model so we can
  # use glm to fit a poisson model and include a factor for the time intervals ('TIMEID') to have different rates.
  # The vector 'SURVIVALTIME' (the time elapsed between start of follow up failure/censoring) and the vector 'TIMEID'
  # which allows for different rates are generated when the initial table got expanded via the function 'ds.lxus'.
  # In the below model the log of the survival time is used as an offset (some known information to be included in the model).

  # generate a vector of log survival time values
  ds.assign(toAssign='log(D_expanded$SURVIVALTIME)', newobj='logSurvival')

  # Fit the GLM - the outcome is failure status
  ds.glm(formula='CENS~1+TIMEID+AGE.60+GENDER+NOISE.56+PM10.16', data='D_expanded', family='poisson', offset='logSurvival')
